# bstates
This directory contains the basis states of the simulation e.g. an amber restart file. In this case `loop_by_iscu.rst` is this NFS1 loop Cys381 4 angstroms from ISCU Cys138

# bstates.txt
This file is list of basis state strucutres and their probabilites of being chosen. The first column is the strucutre number, the second is the probability of the simulation using it as the starting structure. In this case, since there is only one starting structure, the probability is 1.
